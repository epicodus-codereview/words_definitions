Two classes. one is word, the other is definition.

Need to do all the specs for word that I did for dealerships. Same with
definitions, I think. Then we're going to be able to add defintions to a word.
Word will contain an array called definitions, which will be something I can push
various definitions into.

In the page where I actually see each word, I will have an each loop that will
go through the array of definitions contained within each word object and
print them out onto the screen.

After this is all done, if I have time, I'll make it into a paneled list with
bootstrap.

Need a README.md

Make sure all code is factored nicely. Indented perfectly. Use descriptive variable names.
